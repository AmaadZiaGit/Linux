## The Root Directory

The top of the file is / - this is called root ( don’t mix this with root users)

### Absolute vs Relative Path

Absolute path - Starts from root (/), always work regardless where you are. (/home/username/documents/file.txt)

Relative path - Start from your current location (documents/file.txt (if you in home/username)

Special shortcuts:

- .  = Current Directory
- ‘..’ = Parent Directory (one level up)
- ~ = Home Directory
- cd - = cd with dash takes you back to your previous location

ls -l  : This command  with formats like this (drwxr-xr-x 2 Amaad951 Amaad951 4096 Jan 23 19:23 Desktop)

The first character tells you the type:

- - = regular file
- d = directory
- l = symbolic link

ls -a : This command shows all the files even the hidden ones (files starting with .)

Coming both (ls -la) you get long format + hidden files (files starting with).

ls -lah : This add more of a human-readable size

tree : This show the directory as a tree (very useful)

tree -L 2 (Limit to 2 levels deep.)

### Working with files and Directories:

Create a directory:

mkdir - This command makes directories 

mkdir -p projects/work/2025  -  This command creates a nested directories. The -p flag creates parent directories as needed. 

Copy files:

cp - copy command (if you do cp notes.txt projects/) - This copies notes files into the project directory 

-r with cp - This copies the directory and everything in it

Move and rename files: 

mv - This is the move command. You can move files into different directories 

mv -i  - This helps when you want to overwrite a files as it let you know without it very dangerous as it can overwrite files.

Delete Files:

rm - This command removes files but gives no confirmation, Nothing. Files just gone.

rm -i - This command gives confirmation before deleting

rm -r  - This delete a directory and everything in it. 

rmdir - This moves directories in a safe way. As it won’t let you delete directory that aren’t empty.

### Finding Things:

Find files by name:

find - This command where you place your files. (find /home -name (*.txt) - This find all txt files located in home. 

Find by type:

-type d  - This can also be added (find /var -type d -name “log”) to find directories d = directories.

-type f  - This find files ending in .sh

Find by size:

-size +10M - this finds files larger then 10MB (find /var/log -size +10m)

sudo !! - When running a command and sudo is needed this can be ran instead of running the whole command again 

locate  - This command is much faster then the find command because it uses a database. But sometime the database can be outdated 

### Location of commands:

Which ls = /usr/bin/ls (This shows command’s executable is located)

command -v : Portable way:

-v mkdir - This command much similar to which but more reliable. Also works in scripts w

here which might not. 

Type - This command will let you know if something is an alias, bulletin or external command, Much more informative than which.

### The Man Command:

man - This is the manual command. This is official documentation.

Navigate inside man:

space or f = next page

b = previous page 

/pattern = search for text (/backuo)

n = next search result

q =quit
