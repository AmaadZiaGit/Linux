## Reading and Viewing Files:

Display entire file using the cat command  (cat /etc/hostname)

Cat prints the entire file to the screen. Short for “concatenate” - it can also combine multiple files.

### Reading through large files:

less - this command helps you scroll through files. (less /var/log/syslog)

Navigation controls:

- Space or f - Forward one page
- b - Back one page
- up or down arrow - Line by line
- g - Go to the beginning
- G - Go to the end
- / - Search
- n - Next result
- q = quit

### View first lines: Head

Head command allow you to view the first 10 lines by default. (head /var/log/syslog)

if you want to see more then 10 you can do:

head -20 var/log/syslog

### View last few lines: Tail

Same concept applies as head command for the tail command. (tail /var/log/syslog)

tail -f /var/log/syslog - This -f means follow. New lines appear as they are written in the file. This is how you watch logs live. Ctrl + C to stop following/.

Essential for debugging. When something goes wrong, you tail -f the log file, reproduce the problem and watch errors appear. 

## Searching File contents:

### Intro to grep:

grep - This command searches for patterns in files. (grep “error” var/log/syslog)

### Case-incentive Search:

grep -i “error” /var/log/syslog - The i flag means ignores case. Matches “error”, “ERROR”

grep -n flag shows line number (grep -n “error” var/log/syslog)

### Invert match:

grep -v “comment” config.txt - The -v flag shows lines that don’t match. Useful for filtering out noise. 

### Search recursively:

grep -r “passwrd” /etc/ - The -r flag searches all the files in a directory recursively 

-c - This can be used to count 

### Show Content:

grep -B 2 -A 2 “errorE /var/log/syslog

- -B 2 shows 2 lines before and A shows after

### Regular Expressions:

grep “ (uparrow)root” /etc/passwrd - (Up-arrow symbol don’t write up-arrow)

This command means start with. Find lines starting with root 

grep “bash$” /etc/passwd - This means ends with, so lines ending with “bash”

[0-9] matches any digits. Finds ‘user0’, user 1 and etc  

### Combine with pipes:

cat /var/log/syslog | grep “error” 

## File information:

file /etc/passwrd - The file command examines the content to determine the file type. Doesn't reply in extension.

Stat - This command shows size, permission, owner, timestamps and more.

wc - This command is a word count command (-l = just lines and -w jsut words and -c for just charecters) 

## Directories;

du -sh /var/log - this is disk usage.  The -s flag summaries, -h makes it human - readable 

du -h —max-depth-1 /var - The /var is a subdirectory 

df -h = This command shows disk free. shows all mounted filesystems and their space usage
