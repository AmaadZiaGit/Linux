## What is Linux?

When the VM is running, there is a program called the kernel this controls everything.

The Kernel controls: 

- The hardware
- Manages files
- run programs
- Keeps tracks of users and their permissions

You cant talk to the kernel directly as it understand a different language which is low-level. 

### The Shell:

The shell is a program that bridges the gap. Essentially a translator between you and the operating system. The shell: 

- presents you with prompt
- Accepts human-readable commands
- Translates into action the kernel performs
- Shows Results

Make sure you always are using bash as it is the default. 

echo $shell - Shows what shell your using as they are many types.
