## **Why Vi?**

Vi is installed on:

- Every Linux distribution
- Every Unix system
- macOS
- Minimal Docker containers
- Embedded systems and routers

When you SSH into a server at 3 AM to fix a production issue, vi will be there. VS Code won’t be.

## **Vi vs Vim**

Aspect                            vi                                /lsvim

Full name                       Visual editor           Vi IMproved

Availability                     Everywhere             Most systems

Undo                               Single level             Multiple levels

Syntax highlighting     No                             Yes

On Ubuntu, `vi` is actually `vim` in disguise:

```
ls -la /usr/bin/vi
```

Output:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 ... /usr/bin/vi -> /etc/alternatives/vi
```

Follow it further:

```
ls -la /etc/alternatives/vi
```

Output:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 ... /etc/alternatives/vi -> /usr/bin/vim.basic
```

So on Ubuntu, you’re getting vim’s features. But in production containers, you won’t.

### **BusyBox**

**BusyBox** is a single executable that provides stripped-down versions of many Unix utilities. It’s used in:

- Docker containers (especially Alpine-based)
- Embedded systems (routers, IoT devices)
- Rescue disks

Install it to experience true minimal vi:

```
sudo apt install busybox
```

Try BusyBox vi:

```
busybox vi test.txt
```

Notice the differences:

- No `- INSERT --` indicator
- No syntax highlighting
- Single undo only

This is what you’ll encounter in production containers. The commands in this module all work in BusyBox vi - that’s why we focus on them.

## **Your First Edit**

```
busybox vi test.txt
```

1. Press `i` to enter Insert mode
2. Type: `Hello, this is my first vi edit.`
3. Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode
4. Type `:wq` and press Enter

You just created and saved a file.

## **The Minimum You Need**

If you remember nothing else:

1. `i` - Start typing
2. `Esc` - Stop typing
3. `:wq` - Save and quit
4. `:q!` - Quit without saving
5. `dd` - Delete a line
6. `u` - Undo

With just these six commands, you can edit any file anywhere.
