## **Why Tmux?**

### **The Problem**

Imagine you’re running a long process over SSH. Your connection drops.

Without tmux, the process dies. You have to start over.

Or you’re working on a server and need to:

- Watch logs in one terminal
- Edit files in another
- Run commands in a third

Without tmux, you’d need three SSH connections.

### **The Solution**

Tmux solves both problems:

- **Sessions persist** - Disconnect and reconnect without losing work
- **Multiple panes** - Split your terminal into sections
- **Multiple windows** - Like tabs in a browser

## **Getting Started**

### **Install Tmux**

```
sudo apt install tmux
```

### **Start Tmux**

```
tmux
```

You’re now inside a tmux session. Notice the green bar at the bottom - that’s the status line.

### **The Prefix Key**

Tmux commands start with the **prefix**: `Ctrl+b`

You press `Ctrl+b`, release both keys, then press the command key.

For example, to detach: `Ctrl+b` then `d`

## **Sessions**

### **Detach from Session**

```
Ctrl+b d
```

You’re back at your normal shell, but the tmux session is still running in the background.

### **List Sessions**

```
tmux ls
```

Output:

```
0: 1 windows (created Thu Dec 12 10:00:00 2024)
```

### **Attach to Session**

```
tmux attach
```

Attaches to the most recent session.

```
tmux attach -t 0
```

Attaches to session 0 specifically.

### **Named Sessions**

Create a session with a name:

```
tmux new -s work
```

Attach by name:

```
tmux attach -t work
```

This is clearer than remembering session numbers.

### **Kill a Session**

```
tmux kill-session -t work
```

Or from inside tmux, just type `exit` in all panes.

## **Windows**

Windows are like tabs. Each window is a full terminal.

Action                                Keys

Create new window       `Ctrl+b c`

Next window                    `Ctrl+b n`

Previous window             `Ctrl+b p`

Window by number         `Ctrl+b 0-9`

Rename window                `Ctrl+b ,`

Close windowType            `exit` or `Ctrl+b &`

The status bar shows your windows: `0:bash 1:vim 2:logs`

## **Panes**

Panes split a window into sections. Each pane is a separate terminal.

ActionKeys

Split horizontal`Ctrl+b "`

Split vertical`Ctrl+b %`

Move between panes`Ctrl+b arrow`

Close paneType `exit` or `Ctrl+b x`

Toggle full-screen`Ctrl+b z`

Resize pane`Ctrl+b Ctrl+arrow`

### **Try It**

```
tmux
```

Split vertically:

```
Ctrl+b %
```

Now you have two panes side by side. Move between them with `Ctrl+b left` and `Ctrl+b right`.

Split one pane horizontally:

```
Ctrl+b "
```

Now you have three panes. Navigate with `Ctrl+b arrow`.

## **Typical Workflow**

Here’s how you might use tmux daily:

1. SSH to server
2. Start tmux: `tmux new -s project`
3. Split into panes for different tasks
4. Work on your task
5. Detach when done: `Ctrl+b d`
6. Disconnect SSH
7. Later: SSH back, `tmux attach -t project`
8. Everything is exactly where you left it

### **Example Setup**

```
# Start named session
tmux new -s dev

# Split vertically (editor on left, terminal on right)
Ctrl+b %

# In left pane, open editor
vi myfile.py

# Move to right pane
Ctrl+b right

# Split right pane horizontally (terminal on top, logs on bottom)
Ctrl+b "

# In bottom pane, watch logs
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

Now you have:

- Editor on the left
- Terminal on the top right
- Logs on the bottom right

All in one SSH connection, and it survives disconnection.
